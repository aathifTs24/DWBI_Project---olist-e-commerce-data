# Data-warehouse-and-Business-Intelligence


A Data warehouse for ecommerce data has been created using ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to gather and organize data from various sources. An SSAS cube model has been built on top of the data warehouse to uncover patterns, trends and relationships in the data. Excel is used for data visualization, providing an easy way to interpret and understand the data. This solution allows for efficient querying, analysis and visualization of ecommerce data, providing valuable insights for making data-driven decisions.
